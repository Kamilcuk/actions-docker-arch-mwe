# GitHub Actions Arch Linux Docker issue MWE

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `docker build .`
3. Notice it works
4. Check the [Actions log](https://github.com/nihaals/actions-docker-arch-mwe/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild) and notice it fails to build

If you want to experiment, I recommend forking this repo and making changes.
